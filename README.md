# MultiLevel-FuzzyMinMax

Multi-Level Fuzzy min-max (MLFMM) is a hyperbox-based algorithm that is used for pattern recognition and classification tasks. It is an extension of the Fuzzy Min-Max (FMM) algorithm. The FMM algorithm is based on the concept of hyperboxes, which are multidimensional rectangles that can be used to represent classes' domain in classification applications as well as clusters in clustring problems. MLFMM does not use contraction process to handel overlaps, insted some other hyperboxes are used in the next level (layer) to cover the overlaps between hyperboxes of current hypebroxes. 

MLFMM is a powerful classification algorithm that is well-suited for pattern recognition and classification tasks, especially in situations where data is complex, high-dimensional, and noisy.
